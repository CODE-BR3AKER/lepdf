A survey targeting more than 10.000 people, revealed that remote, flexible workers tend to be happier and more loyal employees, in part because working from home has been shown to lower stress & provide more time for personal life.

Engineering jobs that are remote-friendly include software development and data science. So let's dig a bit beyond statistics.

## 1- 3 Benefits of WFH

- **Better Work-Life Balance**: Working From Home will immediately result in eliminating the traffic & commute to the office time, saving it for personal use. Moreover, most remote positions have a flexible schedule, so you can adjust your work time to your ritual as you please.
- **Location Independence**: As long as there is a laptop, headset & good wifi, you should be able to work from anywhere around the world.
- **Money Savings**: You don't have to eat out, buy expensive coffee or pay for a taxi to get to the office. That's money in your pocket. As a bonus, you get to cook for yourself & eat healthily. (Maybe it is time to get that dream physique after all :muscle: )

## 2- How to find a remote job

Now that you are all sold up on remote work, how to find a damn remote job ?

It is worth mentioning that in this article I am only referring to full-time jobs with a salary (not freelancing or running an online business).

The first thing to consider is whether you can do your current job remotely. If your answer is yes, then continue reading. Otherwise, feel free to move to the next section.

If you already working from the office try to negotiate a wfh agreement with your manager as it may be easier and less time-consuming and it's a good way for testing remote work:

- Ask for 1-2 mornings/afternoons per week to work from home.
- Make sure to avoid Monday and Friday. This can imply that you want a long weekend.
- Make sure to be as productive as you can.
- Take note of what you achieved in that period
- Use that in your future negotiation.

If you don't have a job to begin with, or can't do your current from home, the things you certainly need are: English (writing & verbal) and of course the technical skills to do the job.
