**C**omputer **A**ided **D**esign is a method of simulating 2D and 3D designs by computer. CAD Users often include civil, industrial and mechanical engineers.

CAD has replaced manual drafting, allowing design development, modification and optimization.

## 1- CAD Software

Before starting a new CAD project, you have to choose what software to use. The sector leader AUTODESK offers 2 solutions: [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview) and [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/). We have also 3Ds that offers both [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/) & [Catia](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/).

While the apps have a lot of similar functionalities, Catia & Autocad are intended to be used for 'surface modeling' (ideal for architectural production & aeronautics design), whereas Solidworks is optimal for modeling 3d parts & assembly.

I will highly recommend though using TinkerCAD for a starter as it is free, runs directly in the browser with no need to install anything, and it does not have a steep learning curve.

## 2- Projects for beginners

You should start your CAD journey by modeling 3d elements from day to day life to get used to keyboard shortcuts & shapes dimensions.

After that you can work on these:

- (GEER) Wind turbine: [Base Model](https://grabcad.com/library/wind-turbine-208)
- (GEER) Solar Tracker: [Base Model](https://grabcad.com/library/multi-axis-solar-tracker-1)
- (G2E) Irrigation system by drip-: [Base Model](https://grabcad.com/library/irrigation-system-by-drip-cbtis-122-sw-step-1)
- (Civil) 3d Floorplan of your residence: [Example](https://grabcad.com/library/apartment-flat-floorplan-3d-3)
- (Mechanics) Robotic arm: [Base Model](https://grabcad.com/library/4-dof-robotic-arm-4)

## 3- 3D printing vs Laser Cutting

After the realization of your model, you might want to print it. There are 2 main tools when it comes to that: 3d printing and laser cutting.

A laser cutter is cheap & fast, but only accept 2d models (file format: `.ai` or `.rd`).Laser-cut materials include: Wood, Certain plastics like Polyamide, Foams like Neoprene, Fabrics, Paper & Cardboard ...etc.

A 3d printer is expensive & takes time, but you will end up with a precise 3d model (file format: `.dwg` or `.stl`).3d printing materials include: plastic filament, resin, wax, ceramic, metal powder...etc.

:warning: Tip: In case you are working on a prototype of a product, while printing the model will cover the mechanics; adding a microcontroller (Arduino, RasberryPI..) or a custom PCB (we will talk about them in another post) should take care of the electronics.
