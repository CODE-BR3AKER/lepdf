With more than 600 Millions professional profiles, Linkedin is a gold mine with unlimited connections & work opportunities.

Hence a good Linkedin profile will allow you to stand out & impress employers.

Without further ado, let's go over it section by section:

## 1- Profile picture & name

First thing first is your image, make sure to have your picture taken by a professional camera, keep the zoom level to 75%, smile & have a solid background (no patterns or noise).

> You never get a second chance to make the first impression - Trust Me Bro

Next is to customize your header & make it personable while keeping it coherent with your picture.

Then add your full name. If your name is difficult to pronounce LinkedIn allows you to add audio of the pronunciation :loud_sound:.

In the role section, I would recommend not writing 'student' but rather putting the opportunities you are looking for, as it helps with the SEO when recruiters search for a role to fill.

Example of a good profile:

<img load="lazy" src="/blog/linkedin-example.jpg" alt="linkedin profile example" />

## 2- OpentoWork & Interests

If you are looking for a job, turn on the 'Open to work' option and set it to recruiters only (not to look desperate). Follow the companies you are interested in, and connect with their hiring managers.

You can also flag that you are 'open to remote' if you're searching for a remote position.

## 3- About section & Featured

This is the most important part, as it is you answer the question : who are you ?

Don't overblow it, Sum up your experience/skills in a sentence or 2, Add your career vision/ goals & Use emojis to make it personal.

A good example would be:

- 👋🏽 Hi, my name is Samuel
- 🎓 Soon to be grad with a Bachelor in Computer Science. (Jul 2022)
- 🌇 San Francisco Native, with a passion for saas products.
- 📚 _Talk about your past-present experience, and what you did_ (3-4 sentences)
- 🏔 _As for my future, I hope to one day work in X role_ (1-2 Sentences)
- 💪🏽 _Highlight your strengths, (Teamwork, Diligence, Research ..)_ (1 sentence)

You can also use the featured section to highlight links to the work you have done in the past; only choose the top 2 or 3.

## 4- Work history & volunteer experience

Your work history should have the role you occupied, the name of the company, and the timeframe. Again don't write a long paragraph but rather bullets points highlighting what you accomplished during that period. P.S: Internships also count as experience.

While you could add your volunteering to the work experience, LinkedIn has a dedicated section for that. Extracurricular & group projects are highly regarded by recruiters as it signals the candidate's proactivity & soft skills.

## 5- Education & Skills

Last but not least, add your main learning to the education section. Licenses & certifications in the certificates sections (checkout btw our online courses at the bottom of the home page for some cool certifications).

Then add individual skills badges in their section and take the badge test to have it verified, or have your colleagues endorse you for a particular skill.

PS: You can also get free access to [Linkedin Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) if you create your account with the `.etu` mail.
